# Files for R Tutorial: Principal Component Analysis with Metabolomics Data 

NOTE: The methodology section of the paper mentions 47 compounds, but there are just 14 in table 1 in the discussion section and 29 in the table s2 in the supplementary material. This makes a total of 43 available compounds, which  means and standard deviations are gathered in the file "complete_data.csv". I also substituted the amino acids code (in table 1) for their respective names.
